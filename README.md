# Chatty
### To run:
`vagrant up`
and visit http://localhost:4289. As a back-up, if running via `vagrant up` gives you problem,
you can check out the site live at http://us-east.aurorapool.io/, it is deployed on AWS.
You need to make sure to use that exact url, because there are multiple apps running on that
domain. http://us-east.aurorapool.io/.
You can use
username: testuser@example.com
password: secret
Or you can create your own account :). With love from the Dreamteam.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4289`](http://localhost:4289) from your browser.
