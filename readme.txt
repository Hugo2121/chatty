The majority of the things implemented at this checkpoint is mostly backend functionality.

We have created functionality that uses the Postgres DB to enable our app to save each user, their messages, their friends, and each room channel.

These aspects are important to the developement of the overall app, so were the primary focus at the initial development of the app.

Some other features that can be seen is listing friends, and emoji parsing. For example, users can currently type in :bomb: which will be parsed and replaced with a bomb emoji. This is a WIP, so will be buggy.

Other WIPS include color picker for chat which is saved per user, front end GUI, amd security. There is code that submitted that are at early stages, but not functional as of this checkpoint.
